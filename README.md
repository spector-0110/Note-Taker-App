Note Taking Application:

This README file provides an overview of a note-taking project built using Java, JSP, Hibernate, and Servlets, with MySQL as the database.

Project Overview:
This project aims to create a web-based note-taking application where users can create, edit, delete, and view their notes. The application is built using Java technologies such as JSP (JavaServer Pages), Hibernate for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), Servlets for handling HTTP requests, and MySQL for the database management system.


Features:  

1.Note Management: Users can create new notes, edit existing ones, delete notes, and view all their notes in a user-friendly interface.  
2.Data Persistence: The application uses Hibernate ORM to map Java objects to database tables, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.  
3.Database Management: MySQL is used as the database management system to store user information and notes securely.  


Technologies Used:  
Java: The core programming language used for backend development.                                                  
JSP (JavaServer Pages): Used for creating dynamic web pages.  
Servlets: Used to handle HTTP requests and responses.  
Hibernate: Used for object-relational mapping to manage database operations.  
MySQL: Used as the relational database management system to store user data and notes.  


Dependencies:  
Java Development Kit (JDK)  
Apache Tomcat (or any Servlet container)  
MySQL Server  
Hibernate ORM  
Apache Ant (for building the project)
