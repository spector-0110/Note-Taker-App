Note Taking Application

This README file provides an overview of a note-taking project built using Java, JSP, Hibernate, and Servlets, with MySQL as the database.

Project Overview:
This project aims to create a web-based note-taking application where users can register, log in, and create, edit, delete, and view their notes. The application is built using Java technologies such as JSP (JavaServer Pages), Hibernate for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), Servlets for handling HTTP requests, and MySQL for the database management system.

Features:
User Authentication: Users can register with unique credentials (username and password) and log in securely to access their notes.
Note Management: Once logged in, users can create new notes, edit existing ones, delete notes, and view all their notes in a user-friendly interface.
Data Persistence: The application uses Hibernate ORM to map Java objects to database tables, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
Database Management: MySQL is used as the database management system to store user information and notes securely.
Technologies Used:
Java: The core programming language used for backend development.
JSP (JavaServer Pages): Used for creating dynamic web pages.
Servlets: Used to handle HTTP requests and responses.
Hibernate: Used for object-relational mapping to manage database operations.
MySQL: Used as the relational database management system to store user data and notes.
